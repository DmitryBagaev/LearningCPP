But let me say this. I am a superstitious man, a ridiculous failing
but I must confess it here. And so if some unlucky accident should
befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally
shoot him, if he should hang himself in his cell, if new witnesses
appear to testify to his guilt, my superstition will make me feel
that it was the result of the ill will still borne me by some people
here. Let me go further. If my son is struck by a bolt of lightning
I will blame some of the people here. If his plane show fall into the
sea or his ship sink beneath the waves of the ocean, if he should
catch a mortal fever, if his automobile should be struck by a train,
such is my superstition that I would blame the ill will felt
by people here. Gentlemen, that ill will, that bad luck, I could
never forgive. But aside from that let me swear by the souls of my
grandchildren that I will never break the peace we have made. After
all, are we or are we not better men than those pezzonovanti who have
killed countless millions of men in our lifetimes?
